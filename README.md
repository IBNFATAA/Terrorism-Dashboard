The aggregation uses a new card visual with different format to make it as one and to look beautiful and exquisite with image. Area chart illustrate the months we get busier the most, Stacked column chart shows the day we get busier the most. Additionally, a doughnut chart visualizes percentage of sales by pizza category and pizza size.
